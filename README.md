PHP 8 introduced several new features and improvements that can greatly enhance code quality, readability, and performance. 

PHP 8 introduced several new features and improvements that can greatly enhance code quality, readability, and performance. Below are some of the standout new tricks and best practices you can leverage in your PHP 8 projects:

<h1>1. Named Arguments</h1>

Named arguments allow you to pass values to a function based on the parameter name, making the code more readable and less error-prone, especially with functions that have many parameters.
```
function createOrder($product, $quantity, $price, $discount = 0) {
    // Your logic here
}

createOrder(
    product: 'Laptop',
    quantity: 2,
    price: 1500,
    discount: 100
);
```

<h1>2. Union Types</h1>
Union types allow a function parameter or return type to accept multiple types, enhancing type safety without sacrificing flexibility.

```
function processPayment(int|float|string $amount): string {
    return "Processed payment of amount: $amount";
}

echo processPayment(100);        // int
echo processPayment(100.50);     // float
echo processPayment("100.50");   // string
```

<h1>3. Match Expression</h1>
The match expression is a more powerful and concise alternative to switch, supporting expressions, and returning values directly without the need for break statements.

```
$status = 'success';

$message = match ($status) {
    'success' => 'Order completed successfully!',
    'pending' => 'Order is pending.',
    'failed'  => 'Order failed. Please try again.',
    default   => 'Unknown status.',
};

echo $message;
```


<h1>4. Nullsafe Operator (?->)</h1>
The nullsafe operator allows you to avoid null errors when chaining method calls or property accesses.


```
// Assuming $order might be null
$order = getOrder() ?? null;
$orderDate = $order?->getDate()?->format('Y-m-d');  // Safe access without throwing errors
echo $orderDate;
```

<h1>5. Constructor Property Promotion</h1>
Constructor property promotion simplifies class definitions by allowing you to define and initialize properties directly in the constructor.

```
class Product {
    public function __construct(
        private string $name,
        private float $price,
        private int $stock = 0
    ) {}

    public function getName(): string {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

$product = new Product('Laptop', 1500.00);
echo $product->getName();
```


<h1>6. Attributes (Annotations)</h1>
Attributes provide a native way to add metadata to classes, functions, and properties, replacing the need for PHPDoc comments for similar purposes.

```
#[Route('/home', methods: ['GET'])]
function home() {
    echo "Welcome to the homepage!";
}
```

<h1>7. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation</h1>
PHP 8 introduced JIT compilation, which can significantly improve performance for computationally heavy code, although the benefits may not be as noticeable in typical web applications.


```
<?php
// Fibonacci calculation using recursion - CPU-intensive task
function fibonacci($n) {
    if ($n <= 1) {
        return $n;
    }
    return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
}

// Start time
$start = microtime(true);

// Calculating the 40th Fibonacci number
echo "Fibonacci of 40 is: " . fibonacci(40) . PHP_EOL;

// End time
$end = microtime(true);

// Display the time taken to execute
echo "Time taken: " . ($end - $start) . " seconds" . PHP_EOL;
?>

```


<h1>8. str_contains, str_starts_with, and str_ends_with Functions</h1>
These new string functions simplify checking substrings within strings, improving code readability and efficiency.


```
$string = "Welcome to PHP 8";

// Check if a string contains a substring
if (str_contains($string, 'PHP')) {
    echo "String contains 'PHP'";
}

// Check if a string starts with a substring
if (str_starts_with($string, 'Welcome')) {
    echo "String starts with 'Welcome'";
}

// Check if a string ends with a substring
if (str_ends_with($string, '8')) {
    echo "String ends with '8'";
}
```


<h1>9. throw Expression</h1>
throw can now be used as an expression, allowing it to be used in places where expressions are expected, such as ternary operators.


```
$value = $input ?? throw new InvalidArgumentException('Input is required.');
```

<h1>10. Weak Maps</h1>
Weak Maps allow objects to be stored without preventing them from being garbage collected, which helps manage memory in applications dealing with large data sets.


```
$weakMap = new WeakMap();
$object = new stdClass();
$weakMap[$object] = 'data';

echo $weakMap[$object];  // Outputs: data
unset($object);          // Object is removed from WeakMap when no longer referenced
```

<h1>11. fdiv() for Floating Point Division</h1>
fdiv() handles division by zero gracefully by returning INF, -INF, or NAN, instead of throwing errors.


```
echo fdiv(1, 0);  // Outputs: INF

```
